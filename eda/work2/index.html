         <h1>Rules of baseball</h1>
         <p>The complicated rules of baseball</p>
<p>The rules of baseball may be found at <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/documents/0/8/0/268272080/2018_Official_Baseball_Rules.pdf">http://mlb.mlb.com/documents/0/8/0/268272080/2018_Official_Baseball_Rules.pdf</a>. What follows is a brief summary of the aspects of the sport necessary to understand the project at hand. Note that for clarity, throughout this paper male pronouns are used when a singular pronoun is called for.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There has never been a female player in the MLB, the organization of interest in this study.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A baseball game, under normal circumstances, consists of 9 &ldquo;innings&rdquo;. For the first half of each inning, the away team plays offense and attempts to score while the home team plays defense and attempts to prevent scoring. These roles are reversed in the second half of each inning. The team with the most runs (points) at the end of nine innings wins the game. &ldquo;Extra&rdquo; innings are played if necessary to break ties.</p>
<p>Throughout the game, nine players of the offensive team take turns, one at a time, &ldquo;at-bat.&rdquo; They stand opposite the opposing &ldquo;pitcher&rdquo; and eight other defensive players, carrying a bat. The pitcher throws the ball towards the batter, trying to get the batter &ldquo;out.&rdquo; The batter, for his part, attempts to hit the ball with the bat and &ldquo;reach base&rdquo;. As the inning continues, the offensive players who have reached base attempt to touch each of the four bases in order, wihtout getting out. If an offensive player successfully touches the fourth base, &ldquo;home plate,&rdquo; his team is awarded one run.</p>
<p>When a pitch has been thrown, if the batter swings and misses, or fails to swing at a pitch that is deemed by the umpire to be within the &ldquo;strike zone,&rdquo; this is a &ldquo;strike.&rdquo; If there are three strikes against a batter, he is &ldquo;out&rdquo; and another teammate becomes the next batter. When a team has recorded three outs, the half-inning is over and the opposing team comes to bat.</p>
<p>A batter may avoid &ldquo;striking out&rdquo; either by walking (the batter is awarded first base if the pitcher throws four pitches outside of the strike zone without the batter swinging), or by making contact with the ball and putting it &ldquo;in play.&rdquo; Even if a batter puts a ball in play, he may still get &ldquo;out,&rdquo; mainly in the following ways: the batted ball is caught on the fly, the batter is tagged by a defensive player with the ball while not on a base, or a defensive player with the ball touches first base before the batter (now the &ldquo;batter-runner&rdquo;) has touched first base. While the batter is not out, he is free to touch as many bases as he can in order; he generally elects to stop at the farthest base possible without getting out, at which point he is safe and cannot get out until he leaves the base on a subsequent play.</p>
<p>If a batter reaches base, he may stop at first base, second base, third base or home plate. Ignoring some technicalities, those results are designated as a single, double, triple, or home run, respectively. If a batter gets on base but does not reach home plate (i.e., he does not score), he may still be able to reach home plate when a new teammate at-bat puts the ball in play. Clearly, for a given at-bat, a home run is the best option, followed in order by triple, double, and single.</p>
<p>The rules governing play beyond this are complex, but they are not crucial to understand the project at hand.</p>
