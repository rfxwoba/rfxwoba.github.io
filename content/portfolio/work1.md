Baseball is a bat-and-ball sport whose modern form originated in the United States in the nineteenth century. It is closely related to bat-and-ball sports of European origin, such as cricket.

While baseball enjoys popularity in many nations (mostly in the Americas and Japan), the United States' Major League Baseball (MLB), founded in 1903, is recognized as the world's premier baseball league. MLB is composed of two "leagues", the National and American Leagues, each divided into three divisions; East, Central and West. There are 30 teams in the MLB, of which 29 are based in the United States and one in Canada. At the conclusion of each baseball season (played roughly from early April to late October), the champions of the National League and the American League compete against each other in a best-of-seven "World Series."
